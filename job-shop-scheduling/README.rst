Demo of Job Shop Scheduling
===========================
Job Shop Scheduling is an optimization problem. Specifically, given a set
number of machines and a finite number of jobs, how do you schedule your jobs
on those machines so that all your jobs are completed at the earliest possible
time?

Code Overview
-------------
Constraints:
- Each task starts only once
- Each task within the job must follow a particular order
- At most, one task per machine per time
- Remove impossible task times
